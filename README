   jogma is a program that streams OggFLAC data to an Icecast 2.4.0
   server from JACK. it does not do anything else. just OggFLAC, just
   Iceast 2.4.0, and just JACK.

   all settings are done by editing `config.h` in the root directory.
   you must recompile after changing your settings. if you have used
   any software from suckless.org, you will be familiar with this
   process.

   you will need JACK and libflac to compile. you might need libogg
   too, i'm not sure.

   to compile:

       ./waf configure
       ./waf

   to run:

       ./build/src/jogma

   wrl@illest.net, holler.
